# implementation

- [ ] check the simulation implementation.
- [X] complete algorithm.
- [ ] add Mujoco and Envs.
- [ ] DB class for training.
- [ ] Trainig method in (controller/separate class).
- [ ] link testing with github to perform auto testing.

# Testing

 - [X] Testing software.
 - [X] verify implementation.
    - [X] cost.
    - [X] model.
    - [X] main_algo.
    - [X] decompose update function for simpler testing.
    - [X] test shif and init see also [#3](/../../issues/1)

# Performance

  - [ ] profile the graph with [Profiler tool](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler)
  - [ ] Identify bottleneck and see how to improve performances.

# Documentation
