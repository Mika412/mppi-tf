    - [ ] Test the inference time with different hpyerparameter values (mostly the time horizon and the number of samples.) -> PIERRE
    - [ ] Verify that the logs still happend in tensorboard dispite the compiled onnx version.
    - [ ] Verify results both from eager and compiled mppi.

## Integration

    - [ ] Follow the implementation of Model base. -> PIERRE
    - [ ] Figure out how to include the step model of the RNN repo within MPPI. Not sure of the code status to perform this. -> PIERRE
